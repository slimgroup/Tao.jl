### Future Work

Minimize computation and communication costs over all transformations of the abstract syntax tree such that 
- the transformations follow mathematical rules.
- the transformations keep compute and memory bounded to the specification of the system
- the transformations give an optimal distribution pattern at a given point in the computation
